# Perl Web Advice

Perl has been used to build dynamic web sites for a very long time.
Over time, the best way to build web sites with Perl has changed.
Unfortunately, a lot of the information out there on the World Wide
Web doesn't change and is, therefore, rather out of date.

This site aims to provide a place where you can find the best,
up-to-date advice for building web sites with Perl.

(And yes, we're well aware of the dangers of saying that this site
will always be up to date. That's why the code for this site is on
[Github](https://github.com/davorg/perlwebadvice).)
